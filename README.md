# Data-visualization-in-R
This repository shows how I visualized data in R using ggplot2.
# About the project and dataset
In this project, i reviewed a scenario, and used ggplot2 to quickly create data visualizations that allowed me to explore data the and gain new insights using basic ggplot2 syntax. The dataset is for a hotel booking company which i have cleaned and manipulated, and gotten some initial insights i would like to share. I created some simple data visualizations with the `ggplot2` package. I used basic `ggplot2` syntax and troubleshooted some common errors i encountered.
