# Data-visualization-in-R
This repository shows how I visualized data in R using ggplot2.
# About the project and dataset
In this project, i reviewed a scenario, and used ggplot2 to quickly create data visualizations that allowed me to explore the data and gain new insights using basic ggplot2 syntax. The dataset is for a hotel booking company which i have cleaned and manipulated, and gotten some initial insights i would like to share. I created some simple data visualizations with the `ggplot2` package. I used basic `ggplot2` syntax and troubleshooted some common errors i encountered. Link to dataset is below

# Description
Logged into Rstudio. Imported the data using the `read_csv()` function and saved it as a data frame called `hotel_bookings`, Used the `head()` function to preview the data and `colnames()` to get the names of all the columns in the data set. Installed and loaded the 'ggplot2' package in order to use the `ggplot()` function. The stakeholder wants to target people who book early, and have a hypothesis that people with children have to book in advance. I created a visualization to see how true that statement is or isn't using `ggplot2`. Next, the stakeholder says that they want to increase weekend bookings, an important source of revenue for the hotel. The stakeholder wants to know what group of guests book the most weekend nights in order to target that group in a new marketing campaign. They suggested that guests without children book the most weekend nights. I created a visualization to see how true that statement is or isn't using `ggplot2`. The link to the entire project on Rstudio is below. The both visualizations can be seen on the right side of the page by clicking the both arrows on the top left corner.

# Summary
The geom_point() function uses points to create a scatterplot. Scatterplots are useful for showing the relationship between two numeric variables. In this first visualization created, the code maps the variable 'lead_time' to the x-axis and the variable 'children' to the y-axis. On the x-axis, the plot shows how far in advance a booking is made, with the bookings furthest to the right happening the most in advance. On the y-axis it shows how many children there are in a party. The plot reveals that the stakeholder's hypothesis is incorrect. I reported back to the stakeholder that many of the advanced bookings are being made by people with 0 children. For the second visualization created, the scatterplot has the 'stays_in_weekend_nights' on the x-axis and 'children' on the y-axis. The plot reveals that the stakeholder's hypothesis is correct, guest without children book the most weekend nights.
